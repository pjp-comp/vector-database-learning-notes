PHASE 5 — Better retrieval quality: hybrid search + re-ranking.

Two upgrades that make results noticeably better:

1. HYBRID SEARCH
   Vector search is great at meaning but can miss exact terms (codes, names).
   Keyword search nails exact terms but misses meaning. Combine both.

2. RE-RANKING
   First do a fast search to get a shortlist, then re-score that shortlist more
   carefully so the truly best result rises to the top.

We keep it simple and runnable:
   - vector score  = cosine similarity (real embeddings)
   - keyword score = how many query words appear in the text (simple overlap)
   - hybrid score  = a blend of the two
   - re-rank       = re-sort the shortlist by the hybrid score

Run:
