"""
PHASE 6 — Agentic retrieval: search, judge, refine, search again.

Plain RAG searches once. An AGENT can loop:
    search -> "is this good enough?" -> if not, rewrite the query -> search again.

This mimics how a person researches: you try a search, see it's off, rephrase,
and try again until you find what you need.

About the "agent brain":
    A real agent uses an LLM to decide "good enough?" and to rewrite the query.
    To run with NO API key, we fake that decision with a simple rule (score
    threshold) and a fixed rewrite. The retrieval loop is the real lesson.

Run:
    python modules/06-agentic-rag/example.py
