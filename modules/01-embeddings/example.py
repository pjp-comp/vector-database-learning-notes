"""
PHASE 1 — The core idea: words become numbers, and we find the nearest meaning.

Beginner goal:
    See that "kitten" lands closest to "cat" / "puppy" and far from "train",
    even though the word "kitten" was never in our list.

There is NO database here on purpose. It is just a Python list in memory, so you
can see the raw idea with nothing hidden.

Run (from the project root, with the venv active):
    python modules/01-embeddings/example.py
