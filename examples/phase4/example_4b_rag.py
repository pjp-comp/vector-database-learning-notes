PHASE 4b — RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): the full loop.

The big pattern behind most AI products today:
    1. Split your documents into chunks (Phase 4a).
    2. Embed and store the chunks (Phases 1-3).
    3. When a question comes in, RETRIEVE the most relevant chunks.
    4. Feed those chunks to an LLM as context, and it ANSWERS using them.

About the "LLM" here:
    A real app would call an LLM (e.g. Claude) in step 4. To keep this runnable
    with NO API key, we use a tiny FAKE answer-builder that just stitches the
    retrieved chunks into a reply. The retrieval part is 100% real. Where the
    real LLM call goes is clearly marked below.

Run:
    python examples/phase4/example_4b_rag.py
