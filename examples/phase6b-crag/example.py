"""
PHASE 6b — Corrective RAG (CRAG): grade the retrieved chunks BEFORE trusting them.

Plain RAG retrieves the top chunk and answers from it — even when that chunk is
a bad match. CRAG adds a safety net:
    retrieve -> GRADE the result -> if weak, FALL BACK (rewrite + retry, or admit
    we don't know) instead of answering from bad context.

This is how you cut hallucinations when the knowledge base has gaps: the model
refuses to make something up from an irrelevant chunk.

About the "grader brain":
    A real CRAG system uses an LLM to score "is this chunk actually relevant?"
    To run with NO API key, we fake that grader with a cosine-score threshold.
    The grade -> correct -> answer loop is the real lesson.

Run:
